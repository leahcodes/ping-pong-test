# _Ping Pong_

##### _A Counting Exercise (Fizz Buzz), June 2015_

#### By _**Leah Klamkin**_

## Description

_An exercise in Ruby (often called Fizz Buzz) to practice looping and else-if statements. The code creates a class which can be defined in irb. The user can then pass in any number as an argument and the result will count from 0 to the user's number, replacing any multiple of 3 with "ping" and any multiple of 5 with "pong", and any multiple of both 3 and 5 with "ping-pong."_

## Setup

* _Copy the code in the txt file_
* _On a Mac, open Terminal and launch irb ($ irb)_
* _Paste the code into irb_
* _You are then able to call the method ping_pong on any number. E.g. 45.ping_pong()_


## Technologies Used

_Ruby, irb_
